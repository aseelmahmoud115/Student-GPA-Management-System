🎓 Student GPA Management System in Java
This project is a simple Java-based application for managing student academic records and calculating GPA (Grade Point Average) based on course performance. It demonstrates object-oriented programming principles like classes, encapsulation, and lists.

🔍 Features

Models students and courses using custom Java classes.
Associates multiple courses with each student.
Calculates GPA by averaging total scores across all courses.
Outputs each student’s full name along with their GPA.
Demonstrates real-world Java concepts: constructors, setters/getters, and lists.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java
JDK (Java Development Kit)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Collections (ArrayList)

🚀 How to Run

Compile all .java files: Student.java, Cources.java, Program.java.
Run the main class: Program.java.
View the output in the console showing students’ names and their calculated GPA.

📄 Data Model
Student: ID, name, gender, list of enrolled courses.
Cources: ID, name, first exam, second exam, final exam scores.
GPA is computed as the average of total scores across all enrolled courses.

📈 Output
A summary of each student and their GPA.
GPA is calculated as:
GPA = Sum of all course scores / Number of courses
